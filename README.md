# redditpmbot

A simple bot I made to mass send some PM's I didn't want to manually send.

The bot takes a list of usernames in a text file and sends them a message in another text file. This now has the ability to pick files in the directories. Meaning that you can fill them with many txt files and send lots of different types of messages to lists of different users! I promise it's exciting.

It was a nice exercise for getting into some more heavier bot work and working with the Reddit API.

If you, for some reason, wanted to use this terrible bot you will need to get Praw and edit some of the reddit instance lines. Since the program takes info from the praw.ini file that is setup when you install the library. This also means you can't login to my personal reddit account through this either, which is nice.
