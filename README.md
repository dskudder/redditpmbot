# redditpmbot
A simple bot I made to mass send some PM's I didn't want to manually send.

The bot takes a list of usernames in a text file and sends them a message in another text file.

It could do with some cleaning up and has a completely redundent function. I create an array I dont't need to make since I literally use code that makes one. It's quite bad for that.
It was a nice exercise for getting into some more heavier bot work and working with the Reddit API.
